=========
GIMP Book is a script for managing multiple pages in the GIMP. It’s great for creating comic books,
illustrated books, sketch books or similar. It opens a separete window with thumbnails of all your 
pages, where you can add, delete, sort and rename them. Once you’re done you can export your book to 
various formats, for web or print.
